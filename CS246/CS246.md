# Linux File Permissions 

Permission information: d rwx r-x ---
- first character: `d` if directory, `-` if file
- next three are read (`r`), write (`w`), executable (`x`)
- first three are user, next three are group, next three are other (everyone)

## chgrp - change group

Changes group-name associated with a file

Usage: `chgrp [-R] group-name file/directory-list`

## chmod - change permissions

Changes permissions of a file

Usage: `chmod [-R] mode-list file/directory-list`
- `mode-list` has the form : `security-level operator permission`
- securty-level is: user (`u`), group (`g`), other (`o`), all (`a`)
- Operator `+` adds permission, `-` removes permission, `=` sets permission

Example: `chmod go-rw foo`, `chmod a+r schedule.html`, `chmod g=rw test.txt`
