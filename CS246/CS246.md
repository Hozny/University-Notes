# Linux File Permissions 

Permission information: d rwx r-x ---
- first character: `d` if directory, `-` if file
- next three are read (`r`), write (`w`), executable (`x`)
- first three are user, next three are group, next three are other (everyone)

## chgrp - change group

Changes group-name associated with a file

Usage: `chgrp [-R] group-name file/directory-list`

## chmod - change permissions

Changes permissions of a file

Usage: `chmod [-R] mode-list file/directory-list`
- `mode-list` has the form : `security-level operator permission`
- securty-level is: user (`u`), group (`g`), other (`o`), all (`a`)
- Operator `+` adds permission, `-` removes permission, `=` sets permission

Example: `chmod go-rw foo`, `chmod a+r schedule.html`, `chmod g=rw test.txt`


# The File System 
**path:** is the general name of a file or directory in textual format

Note: directories in linux are just a specialized form of file
- they can be edited but it is dangerous to do so 

## Absolute and relative paths
`/` is the **root** directory

`.` is the current directory, `..` is the previous directory

## Changing the current directory
`cd` to change directory        
`pwd` to display path of working directory      

## The home directory
Each new user is given their own **home directory**
- this is a directory owned by the user where they can place their personal files without disturbing other users

when writing a pathname, the shell replaces the special character `~` with the absolute path of your home directory.        

## The $PATH variable
When the name of a file is given without a path then the shell looks in locations defined global system variable named `$PATH`      
The contents of the `$PATH` variable are a list of pathnames separated by the colon character (:)
```
$ echo $PATH
/home/bob/bin:/user/local/bin:/usr/bin
```

you can run a program by giving its path to the shell           

you can add to the $PATH variable by (this doesn't affect existing PATH values):
```
export PATH=$PATH:/location/program
```

## The command `ls`
The command `ls -l` displays a long form of the list with the following information:            
- **type:** `-` for a file, `d` for directory
- **permissions:** three groups of three bits
    - 3 for user, 3 for group, 3 for other
- **owner:** the ID of the user that owns the file
- **group:** a user can belong to one or more group
- **size:** size of the file in bytes
- **modified:** the date and time it was last modified
- **name:** the file name


# The shell

A **shell** is a program that runs and gives an interface to communicate with the opreating system 

In most linux distributions, a program called bash acts as the shell

SSH (Secure SHell) connection allows us to user the shell on another computer through the internet. 

**Standard input:** `stdin` is a device where from the shell is reading text input              
**Standard output:** `stdout` is a device where the shell is writing text output        
**Standard error:** `stderr` is a device where the shell writes error messages to            

## Executing commands

`bash` can run in an interactive (user provides commands) or non-interactive mode (a script file)

## The command prompt
command prompt is what the shell displays in interactive mode when it is waiting for user input

### Types of commands
**Scripts:** are text files that contain commands in a specific programming language. 
- interpreters interpret and execute the commands

**Programs:** are files that contain commands in binary format. They can be understood the operating system not by a human                  
and can be run without an interpreter 

## Input/Output redirection

### The command `cat`

`cat` simple reads the contents of standard input and writes it back to standard output

### Redirecting input and output
