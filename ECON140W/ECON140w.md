## Chapter 19
**Macroeconomics:** is about the organization of markets to ensure that the "right" number of each pie is produced to meet demand.

### Microeconomics Vs. Macroeconomics
Using pies (apple vs. cherry pie)   
**Micro:**
- There will be a market price for each type of pie and quantity
- People will earn livings based on their skills producing different types of pies
- Interested in the market structure of pie-making firms    

**Macro:**
- It is about the "average" price paid for a pie, is it higher or lower than last year? 
- About the loan rates on pies. If I lend a piece of pie today , how many will i get tomorrow?
- About foreign trade in pies, how many pies are imported and exported?

A main idea in economics is tha the production of goods and services generates income. 

>**National Income:** the dollar value of production of goods over a period of time (usually one year). Calculated by summing the product of quantity and price of products (price $\cdot$ quantity)
- **Current-dollar national income**
- If 200 5$ trinkets are sold, *national income* = (5 x 200) = $1000

>**Real National Income:** National income but measured in constant (base-period) dollars. The price is fixed at some set value to allow for the comparison of national income based on quantity only.  
- **Fixed-dollar national income**

>**National Product** The value of national product is by definition equal to the value of national income. 

A common measure of national income is *gross domestic product* (GDP). GDP can be measured in either real or nominal terms, this course focuses on real GDP.
- Periods when GDP actually decreases are called **recessions**

**Business cycle:** fluctuations in real national income around its trend value which follow a wave-like pattern. 

**Potential output ($Y^*$):** The real GDP an economy would produce if productive resources were fully employed. 

**Output gap:** Actual output minus potential output ($Y-Y^*$)
- **Recessionary gap:** A situation in which actual output is less than potential output ($Y <  Y^*$)
- **Inflationary gap:** A situation in which actual output is greater than potential output ($Y >  Y^*$)

Economic performance is measured using national income, but long term growth is measured by the growth of *potential GDP*. The long run trend in real *per capita* national income is important to measure improvements in society's overall standard of living. 

**Employment:** The number of adult works (15 and over in Canada) who have jobs.    
**Unemployment:** The number of adult workers who are not employed but are actively searching for work.     
**Labour force:** The number of people employed plus number of unemployed people (employed+unemployed).     
**Unemployment rate:** $\frac{employed}{labour-force} \cdot 100\%$. The number of people employed divided by the number of people in the labour force expressed as a percent. 

 
**Types of unemployment:**
1. **Frictional:** Ever-present unemployment which results from natural labour turnover.
2. **Structural:** Mismatch between characteristics of labour force and available jobs. For example, difference in skill set or geographical location.
3. **Cyclical:** Results with the change in the business cycle. 
   
When economy is at potential GDP then there is *full employment*. *Full employment* is said to occur when there is only **frictional** and **structural** unemployment.

**Inflation:** is the percentage change in the value of price - nearly always per year. 

**Consumer Price Index:** The interpretation of inflation
