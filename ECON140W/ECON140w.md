**Macroeconomics:** is about the organization of markets to ensure that the "right" number of each pie is produced to meet demand.

## Microeconomics Vs. Macroeconomics
Using pies (apple vs. cherry pie)   
**Micro:**
- There will be a market price for each type of pie and quantity
- People will earn livings based on their skills producing different types of pies
- Interested in the market structure of pie-making firms    

**Macro:**
- It is about the "average" price paid for a pie, is it higher or lower than last year? 
- About the loan rates on pies. If I lend a piece of pie today , how many will i get tomorrow?
- About foreign trade in pies, how many pies are imported and exported?

## Chapter 19, from textbook

A main idea in economics is tha the production of goods and services generates income. 

>**National Income:** the dollar value of production of goods over a period of time (usually one year). Calculated by summing the product of quantity and price of products (price $\cdot$ quantity)
- **Current-dollar national income**
- If 200 5$ trinkets are sold, *national income* = (5 x 200) = $1000

>**Real National Income:** National income but measured in constant (base-period) dollars. The price is fixed at some set value to allow for the comparison of national income based on quantity only.  
- To get real income you usually divide the nominal income by the inflation rate
- **Fixed-dollar national income**

>**National Product** The value of national product is by definition equal to the value of national income. 

A common measure of national income is *gross domestic product* (GDP). GDP can be measured in either real or nominal terms, this course focuses on real GDP.
- Periods when GDP actually decreases are called **recessions**

**Business cycle:** fluctuations in real national income around its trend value which follow a wave-like pattern. 

**Potential output ($Y^*$):** The real GDP an economy would produce if productive resources were fully employed. 

**Output gap:** Actual output minus potential output ($Y-Y^*$)
- **Recessionary gap:** A situation in which actual output is less than potential output ($Y <  Y^*$)
- **Inflationary gap:** A situation in which actual output is greater than potential output ($Y >  Y^*$)

Economic performance is measured using national income, but long term growth is measured by the growth of *potential GDP*. The long run trend in real *per capita* national income is important to measure improvements in society's overall standard of living. 

**Employment:** The number of adult works (15 and over in Canada) who have jobs.    
**Unemployment:** The number of adult workers who are not employed but are actively searching for work.     
**Labour force:** The number of people employed plus number of unemployed people (employed+unemployed).     
**Unemployment rate:** $\frac{employed}{labour-force} \cdot 100\%$. The number of people employed divided by the number of people in the labour force expressed as a percent. 

 
**Types of unemployment:**
1. **Frictional:** Ever-present unemployment which results from natural labour turnover.
2. **Structural:** Mismatch between characteristics of labour force and available jobs. For example, difference in skill set or geographical location.
3. **Cyclical:** Results with the change in the business cycle. 
   
When economy is at potential GDP then there is *full employment*. *Full employment* is said to occur when there is only **frictional** and **structural** unemployment.

**Inflation:** is the percentage change in the value of price - nearly always per year. 

**Consumer Price Index:** The interpretation of inflation
- Index of how the average prices of goods bought by a typical consumer in a base year have changed between the base year and the current year
- The number is only meaningful in relation to the base year where the value is 100

Anticipated inflation has a smaller effect on the economy than unanticipated inflation

## Interest Rates    
**Interest rates:**
- There are many interest rates (bonds, treasury bills, saving accounts, mortgages, GIC's ... one day, 7-day, 10-year, etc...). 
- In macroeconomics, because all these interest rates move together and vary for reasons of risk, collateral, term to maturity. 
  - We abstract that there is one interest rate **currency of issue**

If I lend **$6.00** and the interest rate is **12%** per year, I get **$6.72** back when my loan is repaid next year. 
- **$6.00** *principle*, **$0.72** *interest rate*

>**The real interest rate** = nominal interest rate - the rate of inflation
>- The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for changes in the purchasing power of money 
>- Example: 12% (nominal) - 10% (inflation rate) = 2% (real interest)

Determining interest rates:
- Central bank usually has a lot of influence on shorter term interest rates
- Banks play important role in determining interest rates

## Employment and Unemployment 
There is always some positive number of people unemployed:

**Frictional unemployment:** people randomly between jobs “normal turnover”

**Structural Unemployment:** people whose skills do not match current labour market needs (example pen and ink draftsman)
Some frictional unemployment can be seasonal 
- you are a ski instructor and a tree planter
- but there is a period where neither business hires for weather reasons
- Each may occur when lots of students hit the job market
- Statistics Canada produces a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate that deal with that problem

**We might want to Minimize both frictional and structural unemployment with good policies:**
1. Examples
2. Retraining 
3. Education be general enough (if too specific may experience structural unemployment)
4. Subsidize moving 
5. Internet job search and its effects       

The economy is at full employment or potential output if the only forms of unemployment are frictional and/or structural

Macroeconomics is most interested in cyclical unemployment
- When real national income falls, and fewer people are needed to produce it - these people are laid off 


Cyclical UE = total unemployment - (structural + frictional)
- Positive is a bad thing because it signals we are producing less output and therefore need less people to produce that output
- Zero if at potential output
- Can be negative as well

Unemployment matters since
- There are strong social reasons to know that mental health, physical health, children's opportunities are all worse for the unemployed
- People who are cyclically unemployed

## Productivity 
**Why would total output increase in Canada?**
- Technological change 
- More people
- More capital 
- There is no agreement on what causes output to rise in the long run 

**Productivity**
- If we divide the amount of real income by the number of workers that produced it, we have real output (real GDP) per worker
- To be even more accurate - we might want to measure real output per hour of work

## **International Sector**
## Exchange rate
- In this course the value of other currencies in Canadian dollars is the exchange rate 
  - If the price increases, the Canadian dollar is weaker
  - If the price decreases, the Canadian dollar is stronger

Net Exports are called the **trade balance**

## Chapter 21
Intro: 
- We build simplest possible short-run macroeconomic model 
- Learn techniques and definitions
- Even this model has 
- Central idea: 
  - Desired expenditure (aggregate demand) will equal Actual Expenditure = Actual output
  - We are trying to understand fluctuations in actual output/income/GDP by understanding spending decisions by households and firms 
# <p style="text-align: center;"> 16/1/20 </p>
# <p style="text-align: center;"> Khan Academy </p>
## GDP - Expenditure approach
$GDP = Y = I + C + G + X - IM$ 
- Investment (spending by firms on things that are used to produce final goods later) and new real estate
  - new real estate means a house that did not previously exist (not a transfer of ownership)
- consumption (everything households purchase except new real estate)
- Government spending
- Exports
- Imports
- ($X - IM$ is commonly grouped as $NX$, net exports)

Example: The sale of a used car is not produced **this year** so it is not included in GDP
- gdp measures the sales of **final** goods over a **period of time** (usually a year). 

## GDP - Income approach 
$Y = w + i + r + p$
- wages earned from labour
- interest earned on capital
- rent earned on land
- profits earned on entrepreneurship  
  
## Trade Balance
The difference in exports and imports is called the **trade balance**, if there are more imports then the country has a **trade deficit** if there are more exports it has a **trade surplus**


## Short-run movements in output 

# <p style="text-align: center;"> Midterm Notes </p>
# <p style="text-align: center;"> Chapter 19 </p>
# 19.1 **Key Macroeconomic Variables**
## **National income and national product**
Economists define national product such that is equal to national product
- everything is sold to someone, so money-spent = income, by definition

>**Nominal national income: **Total national income measured in current dollars
- also called current-dollar national income

>**Real national income:** National income measured in constant (base-period) dollars. 
- also called constant-dollar national income
- it changes **only** when quantity changes
  - this is because prices are fixed so only quantity can change the total

>**Recession**: When real gdp decreases


>Business cycle: fluctuations of real national income around its trend value (follows a wave-like pattern)

**Potential output ($Y^*$)**: The real GDP that the economy if its productive resources were fully employed. 
- Also called potential GDP
- must be estimated using statistical methods, so there can be disagreements about its value. Whereas actual output can be measured. 

>**Output gap ($Y^* - Y$)**: Actual output minus potential output

>**Recessionary gap ($Y < Y^*$)**: when actual output is less than potential output

>**Inflationary gap ($Y > Y^*$)**: when actual input is more than potential output
- This means that output is more than what the economy can produced on a **sustained basis**
  - Example: workers work longer hours than normal 

If you graph the percentage deviation of actual GDP areas of the graph above $y=0$ are *inflationary gaps*, and areas below $y=0$ are *recessionary gaps*

Why national income matters: 
- long term growth (shown by *potential GDP*) is seen by many economists as more important than short-run movements in the business cycle
- Recessions are associated with unemployment and loss of output
- Long-run trend in real *per-capita* national income is an important factor in improvements in standard of living
  - although higher per-capita income improves standard of living on average, some people may suffer as a result (eg, shift from agriculture to manufacturing)

## **Employment, Unemployment, and the Labour Force**

> Employment: The number of people 15 years of age or older who have jobs

> Unemployment: The number of people 15 years of age or older who are not employed and are **actively searching for a job**

> Labour force: The number of people employed plus the number of people unemployed

> unemployed rate: Unemployment expressed as percentage of the labour force
- $Unemployment \; rate = \frac{Number \; of \; people \;unemployed}{Number \; of \; people \; in \; the \; labour \; force} \cdot 100 \; percent$

### **Frictional Structural, and Cyclical Unemployment**
When the economy is at potential GDP, ecnomosists say there is *full employment*. But there is **still unemployment** during full employment because of 
- constant turnover of labour (people switching jobs), this is called **frictional unemployment**
- adapting to shocks of various kinds which result in a mismatch of labour skills and current jobs, this is called **structural unemployment**


>There is always some frictional unemployment and structural unemployment, as a result some unemployment exists even when the economy is at "full employment"

Full employment is said to occur when the **only** unemployment is frictional and structural 

When actual GDP falls below potential GDP (recessionary gap), resources are not being fully used this results in **cyclical unemployment**
- Unemployment also has *seasonal fluctuations* (jobs which rely on seasons), Statistics Canada adjusts for **seasonal unemployment** to provide better insight on the **cyclical unemployment**

### **Why unemployment matters**
- The social significance of unemployment is huge because it involves economic waste and human suffering
  - human labour is not durable; if 2 million people are unemployed for a year then their potential output is wasted for a year 
    - if human labour is not used it's completely wasted
- Research has shown that crime, mental illnesses, and general social unrest tend to be associated with long-term unemployment
- short term unemployment is usually manageable, long-term unemployment is disastrous  

## **Productivity** 

>**Labour productivity**: The level of real GDP divided by the level of employment 
- $\frac{real \; GDP}{level \; of \; employment}$
- The amount of labour employed can be measured as either
  - the total number of employed workers
  - the total number of hours worked

### **Why productivity matters** 
- Productivity growth is the largest cause of rising material living standards over long periods of time
- The real income a Canadian worker today is larger than before mostly due to increased productivity of the average worker

## **Inflation and the Price Level**
Inflation aims to measure the average change in price using two main concepts **price level** and **rate of inflation**

>**Price level**: the average level of all prices in the economy expressed as an index number
- given the symbol $P$

>**Inflation**: A rise in the average level of all prices

>**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: An index of the average prices of goods and services commonly bought by households

The CPI is the best-known price index in Canada. The price index is a number with no unit because the dollar fluctuates and its based on the price in a base-period so its not equivalent to dollars today. 
- Currently the CPI is based off the year 2002 which means the CPI had a value of $100$ in 2002. 
- The CPI had a value of $131.7$ in 2017 which means that prices were $31.7\%$ higher in 2017 compared to 2002

> Since the price level is measured with an index number, its value at any time only has meaning when compared to its value at some other time

$$Rate \; of \; inflation = \frac{CPI_2 - CPI_1}{CPI_1} \cdot 100 \; percent$$
- where $CPI_1$ is the earlier year between the two 
  
### **Why inflation matters**
Inflation matters because it affects **purchasing power** (how much someone is able to buy with a fixed amount of money).

> Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money. It also reduced the real value of any sum fixed in nominal (dollar) terms.

Economists differentiate between **anticipated inflation** and **unanticipated inflation**
- anticipated inflation is not as bad (we anticipate around 2% inflation each year)
- unanticipated inflation can lead to more changes in real value of prices and wages

> Anticipated inflation has a smaller effect on the economy than unanticipated inflation

## **Interest rates**
>**Interest rate**: The price paid per dollar per period of time, expressed either a proportion (e.g., 0.06) or as a percentage (e.g., 6 percent)
- There are many different interest rates in the economy, but we use the best rate offered as a measure since when the best rate moves most other interest rates tend to follow
  - The *prime interest rate* is the rate that banks charge their best business customers
  - Another higher profile interest rate is bank rate, the interest rate that the Bank of Canada (Canada's central bank) charges on short-term loans to commercial banks

### **Interest rates and inflation**
**nominal interest rate**: The price paid per dollar borrowed per period of time

**real interest rate**: the nominal rate of interest rate adjusted for change in purchasing power of money. Eaual to the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation 
$$ real \; interset \; rate = nominal \; interset \; - \; rate \; of \; inflation$$

>The burden of borrowing depends on the real, not the nominal, rate of interest
- for example nominal interest rate of $8\%$ combined with $2\%$ inflation (real interest of $6\%$) is much greater burden on borrower than nominal rate of $16\%$ with inflation of $14\%$ (real rate of $2\%$)

### **Why interest rates matter**
- Changes in the real interest rates affect standard of living of savers and borrowers
  - retirees rely on interest earnings from their stock of accumulated assets to provide much of their income
- Interest rates also matter to the economy as a whole, we explore this more in Chapter 21

### **Interest Rates and "Credit Flows"**
A loan represents a flow of credit between lenders and borrowers, with the interest rate representing the price of this credit

Banks play the important role of "making the credit market" 
- channelling the funds from those who have them to those who need them 

## **Exchange rates and trade flows**
