**Macroeconomics:** is about the organization of markets to ensure that the "right" number of each pie is produced to meet demand.

### Microeconomics Vs. Macroeconomics
Using pies (apple vs. cherry pie)   
**Micro:**
- There will be a market price for each type of pie and quantity
- People will earn livings based on their skills producing different types of pies
- Interested in the market structure of pie-making firms    

**Macro:**
- It is about the "average" price paid for a pie, is it higher or lower than last year? 
- About the loan rates on pies. If I lend a piece of pie today , how many will i get tomorrow?
- About foreign trade in pies, how many pies are imported and exported? 

>**National Income:** the dollar value of production of goods over a period of time (usually one year)
- If 200 5$ trinkets are sold, *national income* = (5 x 200) = $1000
