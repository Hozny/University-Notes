**Macroeconomics:** is about the organization of markets to ensure that the "right" number of each pie is produced to meet demand.

## Microeconomics Vs. Macroeconomics
Using pies (apple vs. cherry pie)   
**Micro:**
- There will be a market price for each type of pie and quantity
- People will earn livings based on their skills producing different types of pies
- Interested in the market structure of pie-making firms    

**Macro:**
- It is about the "average" price paid for a pie, is it higher or lower than last year? 
- About the loan rates on pies. If I lend a piece of pie today , how many will i get tomorrow?
- About foreign trade in pies, how many pies are imported and exported?

## Chapter 19, from textbook

A main idea in economics is tha the production of goods and services generates income. 

>**National Income:** the dollar value of production of goods over a period of time (usually one year). Calculated by summing the product of quantity and price of products (price $\cdot$ quantity)
- **Current-dollar national income**
- If 200 5$ trinkets are sold, *national income* = (5 x 200) = $1000

>**Real National Income:** National income but measured in constant (base-period) dollars. The price is fixed at some set value to allow for the comparison of national income based on quantity only.  
- **Fixed-dollar national income**

>**National Product** The value of national product is by definition equal to the value of national income. 

A common measure of national income is *gross domestic product* (GDP). GDP can be measured in either real or nominal terms, this course focuses on real GDP.
- Periods when GDP actually decreases are called **recessions**

**Business cycle:** fluctuations in real national income around its trend value which follow a wave-like pattern. 

**Potential output ($Y^*$):** The real GDP an economy would produce if productive resources were fully employed. 

**Output gap:** Actual output minus potential output ($Y-Y^*$)
- **Recessionary gap:** A situation in which actual output is less than potential output ($Y <  Y^*$)
- **Inflationary gap:** A situation in which actual output is greater than potential output ($Y >  Y^*$)

Economic performance is measured using national income, but long term growth is measured by the growth of *potential GDP*. The long run trend in real *per capita* national income is important to measure improvements in society's overall standard of living. 

**Employment:** The number of adult works (15 and over in Canada) who have jobs.    
**Unemployment:** The number of adult workers who are not employed but are actively searching for work.     
**Labour force:** The number of people employed plus number of unemployed people (employed+unemployed).     
**Unemployment rate:** $\frac{employed}{labour-force} \cdot 100\%$. The number of people employed divided by the number of people in the labour force expressed as a percent. 

 
**Types of unemployment:**
1. **Frictional:** Ever-present unemployment which results from natural labour turnover.
2. **Structural:** Mismatch between characteristics of labour force and available jobs. For example, difference in skill set or geographical location.
3. **Cyclical:** Results with the change in the business cycle. 
   
When economy is at potential GDP then there is *full employment*. *Full employment* is said to occur when there is only **frictional** and **structural** unemployment.

**Inflation:** is the percentage change in the value of price - nearly always per year. 

**Consumer Price Index:** The interpretation of inflation
- Index of how the average prices of goods bought by a typical consumer in a base year have changed between the base year and the current year
- The number is only meaningful in relation to the base year where the value is 100

Anticipated inflation has a smaller effect on the economy than unanticipated inflation

## Interest Rates    
**Interest rates:**
- There are many interest rates (bonds, treasury bills, saving accounts, mortgages, GIC's ... one day, 7-day, 10-year, etc...). 
- In macroeconomics, because all these interest rates move together and vary for reasons of risk, collateral, term to maturity. 
  - We abstract that there is one interest rate **currency of issue**

If I lend **$6.00** and the interest rate is **12%** per year, I get **$6.72** back when my loan is repaid next year. 
- **$6.00** *principle*, **$0.72** *interest rate*

>**The real interest rate** = nominal interest rate - the rate of inflation
>- The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for changes in the purchasing power of money 
>- Example: 12% (nominal) - 10% (inflation rate) = 2% (real interest)

Determining interest rates:
- Central bank usually has a lot of influence on shorter term interest rates
- Banks play important role in determining interest rates

## Employment and Unemployment 
There is always some positive number of people unemployed:

**Frictional unemployment:** people randomly between jobs “normal turnover”

**Structural Unemployment:** people whose skills do not match current labour market needs (example pen and ink draftsman)
Some frictional unemployment can be seasonal 
- you are a ski instructor and a tree planter
- but there is a period where neither business hires for weather reasons
- Each may occur when lots of students hit the job market
- Statistics Canada produces a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate that deal with that problem

**We might want to Minimize both frictional and structural unemployment with good policies:**
1. Examples
2. Retraining 
3. Education be general enough (if too specific may experience structural unemployment)
4. Subsidize moving 
5. Internet job search and its effects       

The economy is at full employment or potential output if the only forms of unemployment are frictional and/or structural

Macroeconomics is most interested in cyclical unemployment
- When real national income falls, and fewer people are needed to produce it - these people are laid off 


Cyclical UE = total unemployment - (structural + frictional)
- Positive is a bad thing because it signals we are producing less output and therefore need less people to produce that output
- Zero if at potential output
- Can be negative as well

Unemployment matters since
- There are strong social reasons to know that mental health, physical health, children's opportunities are all worse for the unemployed
- People who are cyclically unemployed

## Productivity 
**Why would total output increase in Canada?**
- Technological change 
- More people
- More capital 
- There is no agreement on what causes output to rise in the long run 

**Productivity**
- If we divide the amount of real income by the number of workers that produced it, we have real output (real GDP) per worker
- To be even more accurate - we might want to measure real output per hour of work
