### 1.1 - Scalar Functions
$f : A \rightarrow B$ is a function where each $a \in A$ has a unique $f(a) \in B$              
called the *image* of a under $f$.
- The set $A$ is called the **domain** denoted by $D(f)$
- The set $B$ is called the **codomain** of $f$
- The subset of $B$ which consists of all $f(a)$ is called the **range** of $f$

**Definition - Scalar Function:** $f(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$ of $n$ variables whose domain is                
a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and whose range is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$

Sometimes we use $\vec{x}$ to represent points in $\mathbb{R}^n$

#### Finding domain / range
It is sometimes easier to visualize using a picture, example:           
$f(x, y) = \sqrt{xy}$, knowing that $xy>0$ we can see that the domain is the top right          
and bottom left quadrants of a cartesian plane


### 1.2 - Geometric Interpretation of $z = f(x,y)$
In real to real functions we think of the $y$ axis as the height at $x$,        
we extend this thinking to now think of $z$ as the height at $(x, y)$ creating a 3 dimensional surface

In general $f(x, y) = c_1 x + c_2 y + c_3$, where $c_1, c_2, c_3 \in \mathbb{R}$ represents a plane

**Definition - Level Curves:** are the curves $f(x, y) = k$ where the values of $k$ come from the range of $f$
- Set the function $z = f(x, y)$ equal to a constant and increment through the constants (heights)      
to visualize the height map (if the different heights are parallel lines it forms a plane) 

**Definition - Cross Section:** The intersection of a surface, $z = f(x, y)$, with a vertical plane
- set $x$ or $y$ to a constant to find the cross section of the plane at going through that point

#### Generalization

**Definition - Level Surfaces:** A level surface of a scalar function $f(x, y, z) is defined by,             
$f(x, y, z) = k, k \in R(f)$

**Definition - Level Sets:** A level set of a scalar function $f(\vec{x}), \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined by,             
$\{ \vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n | f(\vec{x}) = k$, for $k \in R(f)\}$
