**Main topics & themes:**
- Imperative programming style
- Elementary data structures & abstract data types
- Modularization
- Memory management & state
- Introduction to algorithm design & efficiency 
- Designing "medium" sized, "real world" programs with I/O


**Programming environment (Seashell)**  
customized "Seashell" development environment.
- browser-based for platform independence 
- Works with both C and Racket
- Integrates with our submission & testing environment 
- Helps to facilitate your own testing
  - Need to use vpn to connect (must be on university network)

**Course Materials**    
*Textbooks*
- "C Programming: A Modern Approach" (CP:AMA) by K. N. King. 
- "How to Design Programs" (HtDP) by Felleisen, Flatt Findler, Krishnamurthi        
  
*Course notes*  
- available on website
> Go to tutorials to learn 

**Marking scheme**
- 20% assignments (roughly weekly)
- 5% participation
- 25% midterm 
- 50% final
  - must pass both the assignment component and weighted exam component

participation grading
- 2 marks for a correct answer, 1 for a wrong answer
- Your best 75% of responses are used to calculate your 5%
  - if u get every 3 of 4 right you get 100%
- each tutorial u attend will increase your 5% participation grade 0.1% (up to 1.2%, cannot exceed 5%)

**Assignments:**     
- assignment deadlines are strict, but some assignment questions may be granted a "second chance"
- Most questions are marked with highest score submission
- Hand-marked questions use the closest to the deadline with the highest score
- Assignments can be submitted using Seashell

**Documentation:**
- a **purpose** statement, 
- a **contract**t (including a requires section if necessary)
- unless otherwise stated you don't need templates, data definitions or examples:
