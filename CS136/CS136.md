**Main topics & themes:**
- Imperative programming style
- Elementary data structures & abstract data types
- Modularization
- Memory management & state
- Introduction to algorithm design & efficiency 
- Designing "medium" sized, "real world" programs with I/O


**Programming environment (Seashell)**  
customized "Seashell" development environment.
- browser-based for platform independence 
- Works with both C and Racket
- Integrates with our submission & testing environment 
- Helps to facilitate your own testing
  - Need to use vpn to connect (must be on university network)

**Course Materials**    
*Textbooks*
- "C Programming: A Modern Approach" (CP:AMA) by K. N. King. 
- "How to Design Programs" (HtDP) by Felleisen, Flatt Findler, Krishnamurthi        
  
*Course notes*  
- available on website
> Go to tutorials to learn 

**Marking scheme**
- 20% assignments (roughly weekly)
- 5% participation
- 25% midterm 
- 50% final
  - must pass both the assignment component and weighted exam component

participation grading
- 2 marks for a correct answer, 1 for a wrong answer
- Your best 75% of responses are used to calculate your 5%
  - if u get every 3 of 4 right you get 100%
- each tutorial u attend will increase your 5% participation grade 0.1% (up to 1.2%, cannot exceed 5%)

**Assignments:**     
- assignment deadlines are strict, but some assignment questions may be granted a "second chance"
- Most questions are marked with highest score submission
- Hand-marked questions use the closest to the deadline with the highest score
- Assignments can be submitted using Seashell

**Documentation:**
- a **purpose** statement, 
- a **contract**t (including a requires section if necessary)
- unless otherwise stated you don't need templates, data definitions or examples:

**C** was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1969-1973 to make the Unix operating system more portable. 
- Named "C" because it was successor to "B", which was a smaller version of BCPL. 
- C was designed to give programmers low-level access to memory and to be easily translatable into "machine code". 
- Thousands of popular programs and portions of **all** popular operating systems are written in C.

**C versions** There a few different versions of the C standard. In this course, we use C99 (from 1999). 
- The C11 standard added some new features to the language. 
- The C18 standard only fixes a few bugs from C11
- C2x standard is currently in development. 

## C  Syntax Intro 
**Comments** any text on a line **after** `// is a comment`. Any text between `/* and */` is also a comment.    
**Note:** C's multi-line comment cannot be "nested":
```C
/* this /* nested comment is an */ error */
```

**Expressions:** C expressions use traditional *infix* algebraic notation (ex: 3 + 3)   
1 + 3 * 2 $\implies$ 7  
(1 + 3) * 2 $\implies$ 8
- Because C uses infix notation, parenthesis are needed to specify **order of operations**. This is not needed with prefix (or postfix) notation. 

**Operators:** In addition to the traditional mathematical *operators*, c also has *non-mathematical* operators. With over 40 operators in total (CP:AMA Appendix A).
- C does not have an exponentiation operator ($x^n$)
- ```C 
  4 * 5 / 2 = (4 * 5) /2
  ```
**The / operator**
- When working with integers, the C division operator truncates (rounds toward zero) and intermediate values. Note that rounding toward zero is equivalent to "removing" the decimals. 
- ```C 
  4 / 5 = 0
  ```

**The % operator:** the C **modulo** operator produces the **remainder** after integer division     
The value of `(a % b)` is equal to `a - (a / b) * b`
- **Note:** `(i % j)` has the same sign as `i`
  - So `-10 % 3 = -1` instead of the expected `2` 
    - a fix would be `((i % j) + j) % j`, this is especially useful when working with array indices

**C identifiers:** Ever function, variable, and structure requires an *identifier* (or "name"). 
- C identifiers must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, underscores, and numbers. 
- In this course we use `underscore_style` (or snake case). Words are separated by underscores and all letters are lowercase.
  - `underscore_style` is the most popular style for C projects. In other languages (Java) `camelCaseStyle` is popular. 
  - C identifiers can start with a leading underscore (`_name`) but they may interfere with reserved keywords. Avoid using leading underscores in this course. 

**Anatomy of a function definition**
```C
int my_add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b; 
}
```
- braces ({}) indicate the beginning/end of a function **block**
- `return` keyword, followed by an expression, followed by a `;`
- parameters `(a,b)` are separated by a comma
- the function and parameter **types** are specified (in this case, `int`)
- **Note:** the placement of braces and use of whitespace. 
  
**Static typing system:** C uses a *static type system:* all types **must** be known **before** the program is run and the type of an identifier **cannot change**.
- Racket uses a **dynamic** type system

If the type in a function definition is missing C assumes it to be an `int`: 
```C
int my_add(int a, int b) { //Proper
    return a + b; 
}

my_add(a , b){ 
    return a + b; 
}
```
- "type" runtime errors do not exists in C as the program will **never** compile if there is a type error. 

**Function terminology:** We **call** a function by **passing** it **arguments**, a function **returns** a value. 
- In "functional" language terminal we **apply** 

**Functions without parameters:** use the `void` keyword to indicate a function has no parameters. 
```C
int my_num(void) {
    return my_add(40,2);
}
```
- To call a parameterless function, put nothing between the parentheses. 

C allows the omission of `void` which indicates an "unknown" or "arbitrary" number of parameters (beyond the scope of this course). **Always use** `void`.
- When writing programs, do not write programs which do what you intend, rather write programs which are not able to do anything except for what is intended. 

**No nested function:** In C we are not able to define nested functions. This feature was added to the GNU C compiler but is not found in C Standard. 

```C
int top(void) {
    int nested_func(void) {
        //...
        // This is not possible
    }
}
```

**Function Documentations**
```C ```

**Whitespaces** C mostly ignores whitespace. 
```C
// The following three functions are equivalent

int my_add(int a, int b) {  //Good
    return a + b; 
}
int my_add(int a, int b) { return a + b; //Bad
}

int my_add(int a, int //Very bad
b){return a+
b ; }
```

**CS 136 style:**
```C
int my_add(int a, int b) {  //Good
    return a + b; 
}
```
- a block start (open brace {) appears at the end of a line
- a block end (close brace }) is aligned with the line that started it, and appears on a line by itself
- indent a block 2 (recommended), 3 or 4 spaces: **be consistent**
- add a space after commas and around arithmetic operators


```C 
int my_super_long_function(int a, int b, int c, int d, 
                           int e, int f, int g) {
    return a * b + b * c + c * d + d * e + d + d * e
           d + e; 
}
```
- align code when lines are too long

**Entry point:** Typically a program is run by an Operating System (OS) through a shell or another program such as DrRacket. The SO needs to know where to **start** running the code. 

**main:** main has no parameters (for now) and `int` return type. 
```C
int main(void) {
    //...
    return 0;
}
```
- The `return` value communicates to the OS the "error code" also know as "exit code", "error number" or `errno`
- A successful program `returns` **zero** (no error code).
