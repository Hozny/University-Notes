### Definitions of probability 
**Definition - Classical probability:**
- (number of ways that an even can occur) / (total number of outcomes in S)

**Definition - Relative frequency definition:**
- the probability an even in an experiment or the fraction of times that the event occurs in a very long            
(theoretically infinite) series

**Definition - Subjective probability:**
- 'best guess' by person making a statement of the chances

**Probability model**
1. a sample space of all possible outcomes is defined
2. a set of events is defined. An even is a subset of the sample space
3. a way of assigning probabilites, which are numbers between 0 and 1, to events specified


**Definition - Random experiment:**
- repetitions of a random experiment are called **trials**
- experiment must be repeatable
- may obtain different outcomes under controlled conditions
    - there are probabilities associated with each outcome

**Definition - Discrete sample spaces:** A sample space with a *finite* number of sample points, or **countable many** many sample points           

**Definition - countable:** A set S is countable if the lements can be put in a 1-1 correspondence with the positive integers           
- the set of all integers is a countable set

**Definition - Event:** an even $A$, defined on a discrete sample space S, is a subset of S

**Definition - Simple event:** An event consisting of only one sample point

**Definition - Compount event:** if an event consists of two or more sample points. A is said to **occur** on a trial of the experiment if one of the simple events in A occurs.        

**Definition - Probability Distribution on S):** Let S be a discrete sample space. 
Let $P(a_1), P(a_2), \cdots$ be a set of numbers associated with sample points such that
1. $0 \leq P(a_i) \leq 1$
2. $\Sigma_{i=1} P(a_i) = 1$

**Definition - Probability of an event:** Let S be a discrete sample space. Let A be an event defined on S. 
- Then $P(A)$ is the sum of the probabilities of all simple events that are in A

**Definition (addition rule):** if we can do job1 p ways, or job2 q ways but not both then we can do p+q ways 

**Definition (multiplication rule:** if we can do p ways job1 and q ways job2 then p\*q ways total

**Definition - n choose k:** $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)! \cdot k!}$
