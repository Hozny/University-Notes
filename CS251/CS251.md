# Computer Organization and Design 

## Motivations: 
Course goals: 
Understanding of computer architecture, structure and evolution
- Computer architecture = instruction set architecture & computer organization 
- Instruction set architecture: 
    - conceptual structure and functional behaviour of computing system as seen by programmer
- Computer organization: 
    - physical implementation, described in terms of function units, their interconnection, how information flow among them is controlled

Why this course is taught: 
- Understanding what's inside the computer
- Material is used in future courses 
- Architecture issues influence programming
    - for example initializing a 2D array row-by-row is much faster than going by column

**A brief look at electricity:**
- Comuter work with current/voltage $V = IR$ (voltage = current * resistance)
- These are continuous values (can graph them) 
- Can be manipulated by accuracy is difficuly

**Digitizing**
- Discrete signal (high voltage or low voltage, [5V or 0] most modern computers are ~1V and 0V). 
- Signal is either high (1) or low (0)
- Transformation could lead to intermediate values 
    - we're going to assume they're taken care of and are "designed" out by engineers

**Why binary?**
- Two level are simpler and equally expressive
- Nearly all computers today use binary
- Nearly all computer have similar underlying structure

# Arm Overview

ARM: 
- Advanced RISC Machines
- RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computer
    - CISC: Complex Instruction Set Computer

## Registers
Registers:
- temporary storage units which maintain binary information (e.g, 64 bit register)
- you can only manipulate values in a register 
    - so you take values from memory manipulate in registers then write to memory

There are 32 registers
- can use like a variable in a program, but via ARM instruction
    - each register has 64 bits, eight bytes
    - X0, X1, ..., X31
    - X31 always contains 0
    - Example: ADD X1, X2, X3 (add X2, X3 and store in X1) comes in R-Format (two source registers and one destination)

Example: `f = (g + h) - (i + j)`        
Lets assume X1:f X2:g X3: h X4:i X5:j       
```
ARM: 

ADD X6, X2, X3
ADD X7, X4, X5
SUB X1, X6, X7
```
- it will actually be more than 3 instructions since we need to load the values in a full example and we would also have to populate f in memory

## Instruction
Five general types of ARM instructions      
Format refers to how many and what type of operands         
- R-format: `ADD X1,X2,X3`
    - adds content of X2 to contents of X3; store result in X1
- D-format: `LDUR X1, [X2, #20]`
    - load data from memory address X2+20 into register X1
    - `STUR X1, X2, #100` store data from X1 into memory at address X2+30
- I-format: `ADDI X1, X2, #100`
    - adds immediate value 100 to contents of X2; store result in X1 
- B-format: `B #28`
    - set program counter to PC+4\*28
- CB-format: `CBZ X1,#8`
    - if X1==0 then set program counter to PC+(4x8)

Program counter: 
- keeps track of the address of whic instruction is executing and which instruction will come next
    - adress go up by 4

## Memory
- Arm can access $2^{64}$ bytes of random access memory (RAM)
- Memory accesd with number from 0 to $2^{64} - 1$
- Usually grouped in 4-byte blocks called *words* or 8-byte blocks called *double-words*
    - most memory accesses are to addresses that are multiple 4 or 8
- Both ARM program and data are stored in memory
- Instructions are 32-bits (4 bytes)
- Each instruction adress is a multiple of 4

## Control flow 
- In ARM, no conditionals like `if` nor loop constructions like `for` or `while`
- Control flow handled by goto-like commands
    - branch (unconditional goto)
    - CBZ (conditional goto)
- Special register, *program counter* (PC), stores address of executing instruction
- When non-goto instruction executed, PC incremented by 4. This auto-increment advances the program to the next instruction

### Branch instruction
Branch: `B`
```
100: B #3
104: ...
108: ...
112: ... // this line
```
- when branch is executed PC is set to PC + 4 times the immediate argument
- BTA : Branch target address 

### Conditional branch
Example: `CBZ X1, #100` (or -100)
- Compare contents of register X1 to zero. If equal add 4 times constant and add to PC. 
    - if register is not zero the instruction following branch is executed (PC+4)
- constant can be negative
- `CBNZ` is similar but looks for if the register is **not** zero

Example: 
```
100: ADD X1, XZR, XZR
104: ADD X2, XZR, #6
108: ADDI X1, X1, 5
112: SUBI X2, X2, 1
116: CBNZ X2, #-2
120: ADD X4, X6, X8
```

### Memory access
Three general categories of instructions in every Instruction Set Architecture
1. computation (arithmetic format)
2. control flow
3. data manipulation (memory access) (loading and storing)

Load Unscaled Register (LDUR): Reads a double word from memory and stores this to register         
`100: LDUR X1, [x2,#100]`       
- loads from the address at to 100 + x2
Read value stored at memory address 100+X2 (M[100+X2]). Store result in register X1.        

Store Unscaled Register (STUR): takes the value contained in a register 64-bit) value and writes it to memory
- `100: STUR X1, [X2,#100]`

# Simulator

# Circuits 
truth tables and binary formulas...             
- F = xyz + ... 
    - x-bar represents off 
    - + represents OR
    - multiplication (variables beside each other) represents AND

Logic gates
- lines into scquare-circle thing is AND
- lines into fish-tail thing is OR
- line into triangle-dot is NOT

NAND, NOR, XOR
- negate AND, OR for the first wto 
- XOR is OR but not AND
- XNOR is complimenting XOR

# Transistors 
electrically-controlled switch 
- x = 0 (there is no signal) 
- x = 1 (there is a signal)



# Decoders
$n$ inputs, $2^n$ outputs. 
- a decoder takes in the input and decodes the value 
    - if input is `000` then the 0th output is true, so $D_0$ is true 
    - when one output the other are off
    - if input is `011` then $D_3$ is on
    
3x8 Decoder, 4x16 Decoder, etc...

## Decoder example
We can have a decoder which takes in 2 bits from a 32 bit adress and sends the remainding 30 
to 1gb chip selectors which in turn will turn a memory chip on or off. Then we connect these outputs together to get the adress for which 1gb chip we will be using. 
- basically the decoder is taking in 2 bits and will always turn on exactly 1 of the 4 1gb chips 

# Multiplexors
inputs: 
- $2^n$ lines 
- $n$ select lines (select bits)
    
so 6x1 (4 input bits, 2 select bits)
- there are 
- select bits are similar to decoders (if you have $n$ select bits you can select $2^n$ different inputs)
    - so `00` selects input `0` and `10` selectins input 2

Definition: Bus
- indicates a collection of data lines that we treat as one logical signal

Multiplexor 
- allows us to select one bus or data source over another
    - might be drawn as one mux between two buses but the reality is that it is implemented using an array of muxs

Example: 
- we can computer the addition, multiplication, division, subtraction computed before we know which we want 
    - then the multiplexor picks the resutl we are actually looking for 

# Clocks and Sequential Circuits

Snychronous 
- easier to analyze, tend to be more stable 

Asynchronous 
- no clock, Potentiall faster and less power-hungry, but harder to design and analyze

# SR Latch
We want a configuration of gates that can store binary 0 or 1
- need to be able to read and write this system

S = 1 , R = 0 
- set Q to 0

S = 0, R = 1 
- set Q to 1 

S = 0, R = 0 
- read Q 

if S = 1, R = 1 
- will break the system (bad state)
- we should block this from ever happening

# D latch 
When clock is off there is no change to Q
- clock is a bit 

Essentially changes S,R inputs into one single input D alongside the clock 

# D flip flop
Have a master and slave latch (slave latch has complimented clock)
- if a glitch happens in when the clock is on slave wont update cuz its off
- if a glitch happens when clock is off then master wont even update
    - so changes are only every saved when clock is changing

Our D flip flop updates on the **falling** edge of clock pulse

# Registers
A register will contain 64 D flip flops to store 64 bits 

We need the register file to be able to read from two reigsters and writing to one register
- read from 2 in parallel, write to 1

We need 3 * 5 bit inputs (read register 1 & 2 and then write register)
- if we need to pass data to write then we need 64 bit input

# RAM (SRAM vs. DRAM)
Static RAM vs. Dynamic Ram 

Random Access Memory: Can access any byte of data randomly, not needing to access the byte immediately before it first. 
- provide an address and get the data 

CPU works with many types of *containesr* (storage units of memory) 
- register file, instruction memory, etc.. 
- memory hierarchy is studied later in the course 

Memory hierarchy overview: 
- processor works with memory that is closest to it 
    - register file, instruction and data memory 
    - instructions and data are stored in local memories close to the processor 
- 2 main levels: Datapath Memory, Main Memory(RAM), Hard Drive (Disk) 


## SRAM  
Static random access memories (SRAM) use D latches 
- input: 
    - adress 21 bits -> gives 2 097 152 different addresses 
        - data size here is 16 bits not 32 (4 bytes) 
        - so SRAM size here is 2M x 16 
    - Chip select 
        - there are multiple SRAM chips so chip select lets you choose which to use 
    - Output  
        - we need to control the read operation now too (we didn't need to with register files since we were always reading)
        - there are multiple sram chips but they are all connected to one BUS line 
    - Write enable 1 bit 
    - Din 16 bits 


Three-state buffers 
- motivation: 
    - all data from memory is transmitted back to the processor on the same line 
    - millions of addressable locations need to be able to use this path 
    - if all paths are transmitting binary data at the same time we would have collision 
    - we would also cause short circuits 
    - we need some mechanism of allowing all paths the ability to connect to the transmission bus, however block everyone except the requested
        - allow binary data to transmit for the requested word of data 
        - block all other pathways 
    - use transistors 

- takes in one control bit C and has one complimented NMOS and one PMOS 
    - if c = 1 -> data flows through 
    - if c = 0 -> data flows through as a float 


SRAM is not clocked so bits are stored in D latches instead of D flip flops 
 
Example SRAM structure 
- decoder connecting to d latches 
    - each d latch has an extra enable bit which controls the three-state buffer 
    - so if the dlatch is on (decoder chooses it) its three state buffer receives a control bit of 1 
        - so its data is allowed to go through 
        - all other d latches will have a 0 control bit so their data does not go through (they are in a float state) 
        - data goes out to the Dout bits 
    - we could also write by passing the right enable and then the input 

To add bits we just increase columns to the right
- to add more words we increase rows and increase the decoder 


## DRAM 

SRAM is too expensive (it uses too much transistors) 
- D-latch (22 transistors) 
- Better implementations can use 6 transistors 
    - this is still too expensive 

An alternative is to use a capacitor to store a charge to represent 1 
- problem: charge leaks aways, must be refreshed 
- capacitor stores a charge of what it is connected to 
    - slowly loses the charge 
- need one transistor to read and write the data bit 
- recharge must occur thousands of times per second 
- there is an external controller which is responsible for recharging the capacitor 

DRAM 
- to read we put 1 on the word line and 1/2 on the bit line 
    - if the capacitor was 1 then bit line becomes 1 
    - if the capacitor was 0 then bit line becomes 0 
- when we read we have to write back 

DRAM 
- less transistors / less costly 
- refresh makes DRAM a bit slow 
- refresh is handled a row at a time 
    - fraction of time devoted to refres is maximum 4% or as low as 1-2% of active clock cycles 
    - not a heavy penalty for refreshing 

DRAM is cheaper but slower than SRAM 

# Finite-State Machines 


Variations on Finite-State Machines
- moore machine: output depends only on state (what we use) 
- mealy machine: output can depend on inputs 
- moore machine may be faster, Mealy machine may be smaller 
- Conceptually, computation is infinite (input streams have no beginning or end)
- In practice, need to worry about power-up and power-down (as with all our state devices)
- Different in language-recognition context (e.g. CS 241) 
    - input is single character at a time not a set of bits 
    - because strings have finite length, computation is finite (start state, final states) 
    - Mealy machines used (outputs on transition arcs)

# Data representation 

Characters: 
- ascii 
- 

FYI: Basic error detection when transmitting data 
- parity bit: Top most bit is 1 if there are even 1s, 0 if there are odd 1s 
    - statistically 1 bit errors are far more likely so this system kinda works  

Unsigned binary numbers 
- with 4 bits we can represent 0 through 15 

Negating a two's complement representation 
- hold the rightmost 1 bit and flip negate each bit to negate the number


Addition circuit 
- input : a, b, carryIn 
- output: carryOut, Sum 

For two's compliment arithmetic with **negative** numbers the 9th bit does not matter (the last carryOut does not matter)


For adding two positive numbers overflow is possible
- if the sign of my result is a different sign then there is overflow 

Sign extension (bringing a 4 bit number to 9 bit, etc..)
- take the highest sign and extend it to the left
