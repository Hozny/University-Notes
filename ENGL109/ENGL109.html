<p><strong>Critical thinking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Describes mental habits that reinforce logical reasoning and analysis</li>
<li>When we add the <em>adjective</em> <em>critical</em> to the noun <em>thinking</em>, we are talking about searching for
<ul>
<li>hidden assumptions</li>
<li>noticing various facts</li>
<li>unravelling different strands</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The word <em>critical</em> comes from a Greek word, <em>krinein</em>, meaning &quot;to separate,&quot; or &quot;to choose&quot;
<ul>
<li>It implies conscious, deliberate thinking</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Critical thinkers are sufficiently open-minded that they adopt a skeptical attitude towards:
<ul>
<li><em>their own</em> ideas</li>
<li><em>their own</em> assumptions</li>
<li>the evidence <em>they themselves</em> tentatively offer</li>
<li>the assumptions and evidence offered by others</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When critical thinkers re-read their writing, they approach it with skepticism</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basic techniques of academic reading:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Survey the table of contents</li>
<li>Pre-read to get a sense of the whole</li>
<li>Look up terms and concepts you don't know</li>
<li>Summarize what you have read</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reading advice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read to deepen what you already know</li>
<li>Read above your level of knowledge
<ul>
<li>spend time with texts which are tough to get through</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read what makes you uncomfortable</li>
<li>Read against the grain
<ul>
<li>raise questions about the texts you read</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read slowly - find the thesis</li>
<li>Annotate what you read</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Annotating:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read slowly and annotate keywords</li>
<li>Make a list of words you are unfamiliar with</li>
<li>Reflect on the book in the margins. Ask questions</li>
<li>List questions you have</li>
<li>Link ideas together with arrows</li>
<li>Summarize each section at the bottom of the page</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Previewing source materials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Title - a good title tells what a piece is and isn't about.</li>
<li>A subtitle usually describes the substance of the argument</li>
<li>Introduction or abstract - what the source covers, what its methods are.</li>
<li>Table of contents (book) or headings (article) - overall structure</li>
<li>Charts, tables, illustrations - what do they offer, can you use them in your paper?</li>
<li>Index</li>
<li>Final section or chapter - know how does the material conclude</li>
<li>Bibliography - list of sources indicates how thorough the author has been and points to other potential material</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Place of publication:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In general, book published by presses associated with colleges and universities are reputable sources.</li>
<li>Articles from professional journals described as <em>refereed</em> or <em>peer-reviewed</em>.</li>
<li>New york times, etc...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For academic projects, rely primarily on scholarly works - Wikipedia may help to introduce you to your topic, but do not cite it as an authority in an academic paper</li>
<li>You should base your work on the most current information - look for date of publication</li>
<li>Check the source's documentation, all serious scholarly research is documented.</li>
<li>Journalists establish their credibility by naming their sources</li>
<li>Is it C.R.A.A.P?
<ul>
<li>Current</li>
<li>Relevant</li>
<li>Authority</li>
<li>Accuracy</li>
<li>Purpose</li>
</ul>

<li>Identification, getting someone to identify with you over something</li>
<li>The study of how writers and speakers use words to influence an audience</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aristotle</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds.<br>
The first kinds depends on the personal character of the speaker [<em>ethos</em>];<br>
The second on putting the audience into a certain frame of mind [<em>pathos</em>];<br>
The third on the proof or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speaker. [<em>logos</em>];&quot;</p>

<h3 id="aristotles-modes-of-persuasion">Aristotle's Modes of Persuasion</h3>
<p><strong>Ethos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ethical appeals raise emotions favourable ot he rhetorician's moral character - that is, credibility, authority, and unselfish or clear motives - essentially ethos depends on trust</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pathos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pathetic appeals raise emotions favourable ot the rhetorician's position - influencing what people think and believe based on feelings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Logos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>logical or rational appeals stress the reasonableness of the rhetorician's argument - that is, claims based on facts, evidence, adn reason</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aristotles-proofs"><strong>Aristotle's proofs</strong></h2>
<p>Division of rhetoric into two major categories</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Artistic&quot; proofs, for which the rhetorician constructs the material, eg my client is too good to have committed this crimes
<ol>
<li>Encompasses Aristotle's appeals or modes of persuasion (ethos, pathos, logos)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>&quot;Inartistic&quot; proofs, for which the rhetorician
<ol>
<li>exists outside the rhetorician (surveys, statistics, etc...)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>interprets existing evidence (These three witnesses ...)</li>
</ol>
<p>Both types of proofs can help make a case</p>
<h2 id="ciceros-persuasion"><strong>Cicero's Persuasion</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>[<em>In De Oratore</em>] Cicero explains that the art of speaking relies wholly on three means of persuasion:
<ul>
<li>To be able to prove opinions [<em>logos</em>]</li>
<li>To win an audience's favour [<em>ethos</em>],</li>
<li>To rouse their feelings according to the motivation which the case requires [<em>pathos</em>]</li>
