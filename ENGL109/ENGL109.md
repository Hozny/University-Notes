- In addition to contributing to discussions, it is also important to listen to what others say. 

#### Assignments 
- 3 major assignments 
- They will not be very long (1,500-2000 words), but they will have to be very good 
  
#### Course Discussion Board

### Rhetorical Analysis of an Advertisement Assignment (25%)
- find a recent Canadian advertisement that makes an argument about a particular topic or issue
- The advertisement you pick should allow you to examine all aspects of rhetoric we have been discussing **(purpose, audience, and rhetorical appeals)**, and it should be clearly making an argument or trying to persuade its audience. TV, online, or in print. 
- Some good place to start your search are Oh Canada, Best of Canadian Ads, Ads of the World-Canada, Best Canadian Ads on TV, Political Ad Registry (Federal Election 2019). 
- **Final version is due by 10:30 a.m. on February 3 in one PDF document in the "Final Rhetorical Analysis of an Advertisement and Reflection" dropbox**

#### Rhetorical Analysis (1250-1500 words)
- Make a claim abou the advertisements rhetorical effectiveness
- Discuss *how* the rhetorician makes their argument, such as identifying and commenting on how the ad uses rhetorical appeals (ethods, pathos, and logos) and its success in doing so. 
- Provide evidence to support your claims, and also assess alternative views to your own. 
- Identify any logical fallacies, if any

#### Reflection (250-500 words)
- write a reflection discussing the soundness of the ad's arguments
- Take your analysis one step further, why you agree or disagree with the ad, what you like and don't like
- Be certain to support what you say with supporting arguments and specific details from the advertisement.

### Argument Assignment (1250-1500 words)
- Write an extended editorial piece with the goal of attempting to persuade your readers to take a stance on an issue of your choice. 
- Your assigned audience is relatively well-educated and sophisticated, but not academic. 
- For sample editorials you might consult editorials
- You are free to write on almost any topic you would like, but pick one that will allow you to use all the rhetoricla appeals
- Because this is less academic you have more leeway to employ all the rhetorical appeals
- Try to use all rhetorical appeals to some degree, make sure your use of logos is sound
- Under your title
- Avoid well-worn subjects like abortion or issues that have already been settled in Canada, such as capital punishment or same-sex marriage
- If you can't think of a topic refer to New York Times' Top 100 debate topics

#### Reflection (250-500 words)
- describe how you used the different rhetorical appeals
- Make specific references to the piece you wrote 

### Report or Evaluation (1500-2000 words)

1. Research and describe an open or controversial topic in Canadian federal or provincial politics
   *  Avoid well-worn subjects like abortion or issues that hav ealready been settles in Canada, such as capital punishment or same-sex marriage
2. Research and describe a current contentious issue in Canadian Business environments, offering your own informed take on it
3. What sways people to select one consumer product over another consumer produce, one service over another service, or one social media application over another social media application. Compare and evaluate two approaches, products, or services found and used in Canada

  - Citing sources
  - Diction (word choice, jargon)
  - Considering counter-arguments 

**Hope to see personal research for last assignment (survey)**

### Differences in Academic Writing: 
The differences in writing across different disciplines lies mainly in the: 
- Kinds of questions asked
- Kinds of research done to find the answer
- The ways of communicating the answers 

### Cicero
- A good speech fulfills 3 main purposes:
  - To delight 
  - To teach 
  - To move 
- Writing today has similar motivations

### Choosing a topic
- Choose a topic you are interested in
- Narrow enough (environmental concerns is too broad)
  - Specific recycling method of a plastic and its environmental impact is a better topic

### Rhetoric stuffs
- Ethos
  - Ethical appeal 

### Questions to consider
1. What is your overall attitude toward the top? How strong are your opinions? 
2. What social, political, religious, personal, or other influences have contributed to your attitude? 
3. How much do you know about the topic? What questions do you have about it? 
4. What interests you most about the topic? Why? 
5. What interests you least about it? Why?
6. What seems important or unimportant about the topic? 
7. What do you expect to conclude about the topic? 
8. How will you establish your credibility (ethos)? That is, how will you show that you are knowledgeable and trustworthy?
    - Expected to have **at least 3 citations**

**Critical thinking:**
- Describes mental habits that reinforce logical reasoning and analysis
- When we add the *adjective* *critical* to the noun *thinking*, we are talking about searching for 
  - hidden assumptions
  - noticing various facts
  - unravelling different strands
- The word *critical* comes from a Greek word, *krinein*, meaning "to separate," or "to choose"
  - It implies conscious, deliberate thinking
- Critical thinkers are sufficiently open-minded that they adopt a skeptical attitude towards: 
  - *their own* ideas
  - *their own* assumptions
  - the evidence *they themselves* tentatively offer
  - the assumptions and evidence offered by others
- When critical thinkers re-read their writing, they approach it with skepticism 

**Basic techniques of academic reading:**
- Survey the table of contents
- Pre-read to get a sense of the whole
- Look up terms and concepts you don't know
- Summarize what you have read

**Reading advice:**
- Read to deepen what you already know
- Read above your level of knowledge
  - spend time with texts which are tough to get through
- Read what makes you uncomfortable
- Read against the grain
  - raise questions about the texts you read
- Read slowly - find the thesis
- Annotate what you read 

**Annotating:**
- Read slowly and annotate keywords
- Make a list of words you are unfamiliar with
- Reflect on the book in the margins. Ask questions
- List questions you have
- Link ideas together with arrows
- Summarize each section at the bottom of the page

**Previewing source materials:**
- Title - a good title tells what a piece is and isn't about. 
- A subtitle usually describes the substance of the argument
- Introduction or abstract - what the source covers, what its methods are. 
- Table of contents (book) or headings (article) - overall structure 
- Charts, tables, illustrations - what do they offer, can you use them in your paper? 
- Index 
- Final section or chapter - know how does the material conclude
- Bibliography - list of sources indicates how thorough the author has been and points to other potential material 

**Place of publication:**
- In general, book published by presses associated with colleges and universities are reputable sources. 
- Articles from professional journals described as *refereed* or *peer-reviewed*. 
- New york times, etc... 

**Sources:**
- For academic projects, rely primarily on scholarly works - Wikipedia may help to introduce you to your topic, but do not cite it as an authority in an academic paper
- You should base your work on the most current information - look for date of publication
- Check the source's documentation, all serious scholarly research is documented. 
- Journalists establish their credibility by naming their sources
- Is it C.R.A.A.P?
  - Current
  - Relevant 
  - Authority
  - Accuracy
  - Purpose

  - Actor is falling in love with the car
  - Author is evoking
    - Guilt 
    - Love

## **What is Rhetoric?**
Ch. 14 of textboko
- Identification, getting someone to identify with you over something
- The study of how writers and speakers use words to influence an audience

**Aristotle**
>"Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds.  
>The first kinds depends on the personal character of the speaker [*ethos*];  
>The second on putting the audience into a certain frame of mind [*pathos*];   
>The third on the proof or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speaker. [*logos*];"   

## **Modes of Persuasion**
- Ethos
  - Speaker's credibility, audience values
- Logos
  - Arrangement, evidence, and logic
- Pathos
  - Emotional effect of speaker's words

### Aristotle's Modes of Persuasion
**Ethos**
- Ethical appeals raise emotions favourable ot he rhetorician's moral character - that is, credibility, authority, and unselfish or clear motives - essentially ethos depends on trust

**Pathos**
- Pathetic appeals raise emotions favourable ot the rhetorician's position - influencing what people think and believe based on feelings

**Logos** 
- logical or rational appeals stress the reasonableness of the rhetorician's argument - that is, claims based on facts, evidence, adn reason 

## **Aristotle's proofs**
Division of rhetoric into two major categories
1. "Artistic" proofs, for which the rhetorician constructs the material, eg my client is too good to have committed this crimes
   1. Encompasses Aristotle's appeals or modes of persuasion (ethos, pathos, logos)
2. "Inartistic" proofs, for which the rhetorician 
   1. exists outside the rhetorician (surveys, statistics, etc...)
3. interprets existing evidence (These three witnesses ...)

Both types of proofs can help make a case

## **Cicero's Persuasion**
- [*In De Oratore*] Cicero explains that the art of speaking relies wholly on three means of persuasion: 
  - To be able to prove opinions [*logos*]
  - To win an audience's favour [*ethos*],
  - To rouse their feelings according to the motivation which the case requires [*pathos*]

## **Writing a Rhetorical Analysis**
- Take the words and images seriously
  - Identify fair and effective techniques of persuasion
  - Expose the crooked ones as well, such as logical fallacies 
- Spend time with texts
  - Carefully study and evaluate the techniques of the write, speaker, or artist until you know them inside out
- Pay attention to audience
  - Understand for whom the text is written, which is as important as what it says. 
  - Audience often determines content, shape, and language of most arguments
- Mine the text for evidence
  - Point to subtle language
  - Over-blown emotional appeals
  - Intricate logic
  - Covert bigotry to support your claims in a rhetorical analysis

## Creating a structure for your rhetorical analysis 
- Once u have a thesis
  - Introduction leading to a claim
  - First support reason + textual evidence
  - Second support reason + textual evidence
  - Third support reason + textual evidence

Style and design
- Write in a formal or high style
- Keep the tone respectful and technical

Make the text accessible to readers
- Assume your readers have not watched the ad
- TO achieve this clarity, summarize and quote selectively from the text as you examine it. You may also wish to additionally provide visual images that are captioned or annotated
- For the advertisement, describe or summarize the content of the work 
- As you examine it, be sure to identify the authors/creators, title, place/mode of publications, and date in your paper

Stanley fish, the other car : page 294 for third edition
- What are the rhetorical appeals that fish identifies in the advertisements? What is the dominant rhetorical appeal of the ads? 
- The online version of this article includes links to the three ads that fish analyzes. Do we need to be able to see the advertisements to understand Fish's analysis?

## Logical Fallacies 
- honest fair-minded writers have nothing to hide. They name names, cite sources, and generate appropriate emotions

## Fallacies of Emotional (Pathos) Arguments

  - exaggerating possible dangers well beyond their statistical likelihood
- Either/Or Choices
  - Reduce complicated issues to excessively simple terms 
- Slipper-Slope Arguments
  - Portray today's tiny mister as tomorrow's slide into disaster
    - if we ban assault rifles we will inevitably ban all guns

- Dogmatism
  - Writers who asserts or assumes a particular position is the only one that is acceptable
    - "no serious person would disagree" 
- Ad Hominem
  - attack the character of a person rather than the claim
- Stacking the deck 
  - showing only one side of the story - the one in their favour

## Fallacies of Logical (Logos) Arguments
- Hasty or sweeping generalizations
  - an inference drawn from insufficient evidence 
    - my Jetta broke down, so all Jetta must be junk 
- Faulty causality 
  - *post hoc*: "after this, because of this"
    - I put on my lucky shirt causing the blue jays to start winning 
- Begging the question
  - the claim is made on grounds that can't be accepted as true because those grounds are in question
    - "you can't give me a C because I'm an A student" 
- Equivocation
  - half-truths or arguments that give lies an an hones appearance 
- non sequitur
  - an argument whose claims, reasons, or warrant don't connect logically
- Straw man attack 
  - portraying opponents position as more extreme or far less coherent than they actually are
- Red herring 
  - changes the subject abruptly or introduces an irrelevant claim or fact to throw readers or listeners off the trail
- Faulty analogy

## Advertisement Reflection
- comment on your own work - and be candid. I would like to know what you learned from this assignment, and what you intend to work on in subsequent assignments
- To get you started with your reflection, you may wish to focus on a point or two from this list and discuss: 
  - your goals in writing the rhetorical analysis and how well you have met them 
  - how you have defined your audience/readers and how you've adjusted your paper for them 
  - the strategies behind your organization or style
  - how you addressed problems pointed out by your peer editors
  - what you believe succeeds and what you'd like to handle better 
  - what specifically you learned from composing the paper 


## What is Plagiarism? 
- using someone else's **ideas**, **writing**, or other **intellectual property** as your own 

## Common Types of Plagiarism 
- Downloading or buying a research paper
- Copy and pasting

## MLA
- in-text citation is (author-name page-number)
  - if there is no page number, just the author's name 
- No known author
  - title in quotation marks 
    - italicize and abbreviate if its longer

## Basic Rules
- all entries must correspond to the works cited in your main text 
- Begin your works cited on a separate page at the end 
- Double space all citations, but do not skip spaces between entries
- Indent the second and subsequent lines of citations by 0.5 inches to create a hanging indent
- For online sources, you should include a location to show where you found the source, 
# <p style="text-align: center;"> 3/2/20 </p>
## Argument Assignment 
- state where your article will be published 

## Reflection
- explain why you wrote the piece as you did 
- point out where oyu used the rhetorical appeals (ethos, pathos, logos)
- explain why you chose to argue your case in the way you did

## Types
- Forensic
- Epideictic
- Deliberative speeches
  - concerns what should be done in the future, typical of governing bodies


# <p style="text-align: center;"> 5/2/2020 </p>
## Arguments
- kairos - recognizing the most suitable time

## Audience

## Ethos
- The identity that writers create for themselves within an argument is their ethos - the voice and attitude they fashion to enhance their appeal 
- You can shape your ethos by adjusting the style, tone, and vocabulary of your argument. 
  - Contractions can make you seem friendly
  - Impressive vocabulary can make you seem smart (or maybe just pompous)
  - Lots of name dropping can make you seem hop (or insulting)

## Materials 
- Arguments often deal with current events and topics
- As you gather materials, select only the best for your argument
- Come up with reasons to support your claim as soon as you choose your subject 
- Write them down 
- Then start reading and continue to list new reasons as they arise 
- Once your reading and research is complete
  - Review your notes
  - Group together all the arguments that support your position
  - Your initial list of potential arguments should be streamlined into just three or four - which should become the key reasons behind your claim
  - Study these points and look for logical connections and sequences
  - Readers will expect your ideas to connect logically

## Evidence

## Counterarguments
- Find counterarguments and list reasonable objections to your claim
- Cluster these objections together while making notes to reduce them to a manageable few
- Decide which counterarguments you must refute in detail, which you might handle briefly

## Pathos
- Consider emotional appeals and use them within your argument
- Questions to answer about possible emotional appeals include: 
  - What emotions might be effectively raised to support my point? 
  - How might I responsibly introduce such feelings: through words, images, colour, sound? 
  - How might any feelings my subject arouses work with my argument 

## A writer's play on emotions
- Look for place where you can generate strong feelings to support your points, win over readers, or influence them in other ways

## Similes and Metaphors
- Helpful in building understanding are specific types of figurative language, including similes, metaphors, and analogies

## Analogies
- Compare similar features of two dissimilar things; they explain something unfamiliar based on a familiar context

## Avoid Cliches 
- a cliche is a frequently used expression such as busy as a bee or children are the future 
- if you use too many cliches in your writing, however, readers may conclude that what you are saying is not very new or interesting - or true

## Avoid Mixed Metaphors
- Mixed metaphors are comparisons that are not consistent
- Instead of creating a clear impression, they confuse the reader by pitting one image against another. 
  - the lectures were brilliant comets streaking through the night sky, showering listener with a torrential rain of insight   
    - The images of streaking light and heavy precipitation is inconsistent
