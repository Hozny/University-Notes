#### Rhetorical Analysis (1250-1500 words)

- Identify any logical fallacies, if any

### Argument Assignment (1250-1500 words)
- Write an extended editorial piece with the goal of attempting to persuade your readers to take a stance on an issue of your choice. 
- Your assigned audience is relatively well-educated and sophisticated, but not academic. 
- For sample editorials you might consult editorials
- You are free to write on almost any topic you would like, but pick one that will allow you to use all the rhetoricla appeals
- Because this is less academic you have more leeway to employ all the rhetorical appeals
- Try to use all rhetorical appeals to some degree, make sure your use of logos is sound

**Hope to see personal research for last assignment (survey)**

### Differences in Academic Writing: 
The differences in writing across different disciplines lies mainly in the: 
- Kinds of questions asked
- Kinds of research done to find the answer
- The ways of communicating the answers 

### Cicero
- A good speech fulfills 3 main purposes:
  - To delight 
  - To teach 
  - To move 
- Writing today has similar motivations

### Choosing a topic
- Choose a topic you are interested in
- Narrow enough (environmental concerns is too broad)
  - Specific recycling method of a plastic and its environmental impact is a better topic

### Rhetoric stuffs
- Ethos
  - Ethical appeal 

### Questions to consider
1. What is your overall attitude toward the top? How strong are your opinions? 
2. What social, political, religious, personal, or other influences have contributed to your attitude? 
3. How much do you know about the topic? What questions do you have about it? 
4. What interests you most about the topic? Why? 
5. What interests you least about it? Why?
6. What seems important or unimportant about the topic? 
7. What do you expect to conclude about the topic? 
8. How will you establish your credibility (ethos)? That is, how will you show that you are knowledgeable and trustworthy?

**Critical thinking:**
- Describes mental habits that reinforce logical reasoning and analysis
- When we add the *adjective* *critical* to the noun *thinking*, we are talking about searching for 
  - hidden assumptions
  - noticing various facts
  - unravelling different strands
- The word *critical* comes from a Greek word, *krinein*, meaning "to separate," or "to choose"
  - It implies conscious, deliberate thinking
- Critical thinkers are sufficiently open-minded that they adopt a skeptical attitude towards: 
  - *their own* ideas
  - *their own* assumptions
  - the evidence *they themselves* tentatively offer
  - the assumptions and evidence offered by others
- When critical thinkers re-read their writing, they approach it with skepticism 

**Basic techniques of academic reading:**
- Survey the table of contents
- Pre-read to get a sense of the whole
- Look up terms and concepts you don't know
- Summarize what you have read

**Reading advice:**
- Read to deepen what you already know
- Read above your level of knowledge
  - spend time with texts which are tough to get through
- Read what makes you uncomfortable
- Read against the grain
  - raise questions about the texts you read
- Read slowly - find the thesis
- Annotate what you read 

**Annotating:**
- Read slowly and annotate keywords
- Make a list of words you are unfamiliar with
- Reflect on the book in the margins. Ask questions
- List questions you have
- Link ideas together with arrows
- Summarize each section at the bottom of the page

**Previewing source materials:**
- Title - a good title tells what a piece is and isn't about. 
- A subtitle usually describes the substance of the argument
- Introduction or abstract - what the source covers, what its methods are. 
- Table of contents (book) or headings (article) - overall structure 
- Charts, tables, illustrations - what do they offer, can you use them in your paper? 
- Index 
- Final section or chapter - know how does the material conclude
- Bibliography - list of sources indicates how thorough the author has been and points to other potential material 

**Place of publication:**
- In general, book published by presses associated with colleges and universities are reputable sources. 
- Articles from professional journals described as *refereed* or *peer-reviewed*. 
- New york times, etc... 

**Sources:**
- For academic projects, rely primarily on scholarly works - Wikipedia may help to introduce you to your topic, but do not cite it as an authority in an academic paper
- You should base your work on the most current information - look for date of publication
- Check the source's documentation, all serious scholarly research is documented. 
- Journalists establish their credibility by naming their sources
- Is it C.R.A.A.P?
  - Current
  - Relevant 
  - Authority
  - Accuracy
  - Purpose
